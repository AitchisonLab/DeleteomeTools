Description: DeleteomeTools uses a publicly available compendium of transcriptomes from yeast single-gene deletion strains (the "Deleteome"") to predict gene function. Primarily, the codebase provides tools for identifying deletion strains with transcriptomic signatures similar to a query strain, thereby associating the gene deleted in the query strain with other genes that may be functionally related.
